Almost all beginner developers ask the same question when starting out:

> What programming language should I learn in 20XX?

The problem is, **that is the wrong question entirely**.

Asking about what programming language you should learn, is like an artist asking what they should use to make art. The answer to both questions is it *completely depends* on what you want to create. Even if you know what you want to create, if you do not have a clear understanding of *why* you want to make it, you can end up **wasting time and money**.

The purpose of this post is to help you **ask the right questions** so you can have a fulfilling development career and avoid some of the same mistakes I made as a beginner.

So what are the right questions? I'm glad you asked. The main questions you should consider are:

- What is your long term vision?
- What do you need to get there?
- Are you willing to commit?

Even if you're not a developer, asking these questions and getting genuine answers should help you avoid stress and burnout from choosing a career path that really isn't for you.

## What is your long term vision

When you get started, the first thing you should ask yourself is **what is your long term vision**?

- Do you want to rake in passive income building apps and software products?
- Do you want to discover the next breakthroughs in Quantum Computing and AI?
- Do you want to travel the world as a remote developer?
- Do you want to be a technical content creator that educates and guides developers?
- Do you just want to solve problems and write code for fun?

This is your opportunity to think about the ideal circumstance. Later in the article, we will take a deeper look at your current and future needs to figure out a realistic path to your goals.

For now, think about what you feel best suits who you want to be. Once you have a target that you're shooting for, you can then work backwards and figure out what you can do today to make progress on that path.

If you're having a hard time figuring it out, that's normal. Coming up with a vision for want for yourself can be a surprisingly difficult and time-consuming process.

One trick you can use to make the process easier is to find someone who is doing what you want to do (or close enough) and study them. Google them, read their content, follow them on social media, and watch everything they do.

If you're brave enough, you can reach out to them on social media, email, or the contact form on their website. Even better, create or do something that will benefit them in some way and use that to get on their radar.

Your goal is to **get inspired** by reverse-engineering their actions so that you can achieve the same or better results. Having a deeper understanding what someone else has done, will also help you get a better feel for how much you really connect with your vision.

No matter what path you take to understanding your long term vision, it is important to focus on the best thing you can imagine for youself and **take action**. Your vision will evolve as you get more exposure and become more comfortable accepting what you really want for yourself.

## What do you need to get there

After looking ahead to see where you want to be, the next step is looking at where you are now. Asking yourself **what do you need to get there** will help you get realistic about the actual hard requirements to achieve your goals.

This will be easier for me to explain by example.

Let's say there are two people. One wants to be a software engineer at Google, and the other wants to build passive income by making apps. Both of them will need to learn how to code, but almost everything else about their paths will be different.

To become a Google employee, you can take a look at the job description to get a feel for the exact set of technical skills they are looking for.

From there. In this step you should take a very good look at your network, education, current skills, and passions before diving too deep into anything.

The two biggest factors in evaluating your needs are time & money. The less money you have, the more patience you will need because you will have to use time to figure out the best thing for you.

The more money, the more you can afford to skip over the BS and learn from people who are doing.

## Are you willing to commit

The last, and arguably most important question, is **are you willing to commit to this journey for at least the next 3 years**?

This is a tough one because a lot of things will happen and change in that time period. However, this is crucial for achieving
the type of success that you really want.

This doesn't mean that it will take 3 years to see results. Many people see results within 6 months to a year of pursuing a change. The important thing is not how long it takes, but having the mindset to **stay consistent** and faithfully take steps that will push you towards the types of results that you want to see.

This is the main reason why understanding your vision is so crucial. If you can't get into a commitment mindset, then you will give up when things get hard or life throws distractions your way.
